# Stack-Visualizer
I made a Stack Visualizer using python Tkinter. Some of the action will perform with animation. Only integer value is allowed to push value in the stack. This visualizer can build up the logic of Stack Data Structure to the beginner. Keyboard event is provided at some place. I think that the logic of Stack Data Structure implemented here clearly.
